# Readability Score

A JetBrains Academy project. Written using Java.

Everyone has their own personal reading history, and as we grow up, we are able to comprehend more and more complicated 
tests. This Java app determines how difficult the text is and for which age it is most suitable.

The app implements four different methods used to calculate the reading age:

* [Automated readability index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index)
* [Flesch-Kincaid readability tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests)
* [SMOG index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMOG)
* [Coleman-Liau index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colemanâ€“Liau_index)
